# CS-340-Client-Server-Development


### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I write maintable, readable and adaptable programs by breaking down features into smaller components and functions. The Python CRUD module from Project One is an example of that. Each CRUD operation is broken down into a seperate function that improves readability and can be tested individually. This module can serve as a CRUD module to other projects using MongoDB.


### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approached the client's requirements by breaking them down into small measurable and seperate tasks. I start then developing code that satisfies those requirement while ensuring to test its functionality whenever possible. While working on the dashboard, I kept running the script and refactoring the code to accomodate the client's needs and requirements.


### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer Scientists apply critical thinking and problem solving skills to facilitate people's access to what technology can offer to facilitate many tasks. For example, in the case of Gazioso Salvare, a company that trains rescue dog, it is unlikely for their employees or volunteers to be fluent in dealing with large set of data. By importing the data into MongoDB, this allowed for easier and much faster data handling and filtering operations. But agai, since technology fluency is not a given, the dashboard provides and user-friendly interface that gives access to most people to interact with the data, filter it and extract what they specifically need.
